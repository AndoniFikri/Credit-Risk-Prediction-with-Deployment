# Credit-Risk-Prediction-with-Deployment

This is my final project for Big Data using Python programme held by Digital Talent Scholarship (Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Informatics). In this project, I try to model and deploy a credit risk application using supervised binary classification machine learning model. I was pairing with Narendra Seta (https://github.com/NarendraSetaR) for developing the solutions. 

I was using python data package such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn for the machine learning model. Then, for the ML deployment I was using Pyhton Flask Library, and a bit of HTML and CSS for the web template. The reference of this project could be access through this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbCWoMf80PY&t=417s 

The data set for the model training is the credit risk data set from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset?resource=download) 

Overall of the machine learning model has the following performance: 
1. AUC Score of 0,98
2. Precision score on default customer of 0,97
